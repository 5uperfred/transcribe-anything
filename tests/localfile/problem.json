    "text": " Welcome to the situation update for Tuesday, January 17th, 2023. I'm Mike Adams and we have a double dose of solutions for you today. I'm going to bring you information gleaned today about anti-clotting solutions. Yeah, could that be useful? And also, a scientific study that was published about spike protein unfolding using a combination of two natural supplements. And word about that has been spreading across social media today for some reason, even though this was originally published in 2021. So I'm gonna read you these two things and basically I'm gonna mention three supplements today that are cited in the science papers that can help in these respects. I've got a lot more for you as well but this is I think the most important news of today. I did an interview lot more for you as well, but this is, I think, the most important news of today. I did an interview earlier with Dr. Brian Artis and Daniel on ball busters. The three of us were there, and Dr. Artis presented some information and taught me something that I didn't know about the molecule glycerison, which I am familiar with that molecule, in licorice root. I've talked about it before, how it protects the liver from Tylenol damage or acetaminophen. But what I learned from Dr. Artis was that licorice root extract, i.e., glycerin, also protects the body from, shall we say, artificial clotting, or no, not artificial, but induced clotting caused by venom peptide exposure. And specifically, the venom peptide exposure that's causing fibrinogen to engage in sort of hyper clotting in the blood, in the arteries, and that this glycerycin actually inhibits the ability of venom peptides to cause that clotting. I did not know that about glycerin. So I learned something new today. And that interview is posted, by the way, on breition.com, as you might expect. I've also got a link to it kind of near the top at censored.news. If you wanna find that, in fact, let me read, here it is, interview Dr. Brian Artis and Mike Adams break New Ground on solutions against clotting. So if you wanna read that, or if you wanna see that, just go to censored.news. Now by the way, on censored.news, I just started doing this, well, yesterday. You're going to see 30 to 40 headlines that I personally am posting throughout the day. You're going to see 30 to 40 new headlines each day of stories that I think are breaking that are a big deal. And it could be from any website. It could be from CNBC. It could be from RT. It could be InfoWars, it could be anywhere. So this is something new on censored.news. It's kind of like a Drudge Report style, you know, list of headlines, but I'm going to be updating that every day with the things that I think are important. So check that out. Those are hand-picked. And then if you scroll down below that, you'll see the automated headlines that are spidered from, what is it 45 plus websites across the internet. But anyway, that's all new at censored.news. Just type that in your browser, censored.news, and you'll see it. Okay, also coming up today, I've got an interview with Daisy Luther, the founder of theorganicprepper.com, and she's also got a new website about frugal living. So we're gonna talk about frugality, which is the new reality for people who are trying to navigate all this inflation and the unaffordability of food and everything else in life. So that's an interview coming up a little bit later. Also gonna talk about pure blood beef and a little bit more discussion about what we talked about yesterday of spike protein or mRNA vaccines in cows and chickens and pigs and so on. We're gonna talk about the Wall Street Journal now admitting that central bank digital currencies are coming. I guess it's no longer conspiracy theory now that the Wall Street Journal says is here. And then let's see a whistleblower has revealed that the United States government is running the attacks on America's food infrastructure, which we always knew, but now we have additional confirmation. And we've got something else coming here, a new climate lockdown concept called 20 minute neighborhoods that we're going to talk about here today as well. 20 minute neighborhoods. And what are these 20 minute neighborhoods? Well, it's kind of a climate lockdown where you're not going to be allowed to leave the sector of your city, anything more than 20 minutes away from where you live on foot because they're going to ban cars. So you're supposed to be able to walk to everything that you need to get to in 20 minutes. Anything outside of that? Not allowed because you're a prisoner in the new prison camp, climate prison system. Well, we'll get to that in more detail, but of course, it's all about enslaving humanity. Okay, also coming out today, it may be live by the time you're hearing this, my new special report with Steve Quayle and Tina from the satellite phone store is called Grid Down What Now? And it's a fun to watch, well-produced conversation about how to survive the collapse of infrastructure, both power and communications and other things like energy and transportation. Grid down what now? Check it out. It's on my channel on brightion.com and on other platforms where we post like BitShoot and Rumble as well. I think you'll enjoy this about an hour and 15 minutes. Also, remember how I was talking about mining yesterday and how I wanted a world map of which minerals were mined in different countries all over the world? Well, and thanks to a reader, I found that there is a world map like that, and it's at the website mapsofworld.com, and it's called the World Mineral Map. And so, if you're willing to spend enough money, you can get a big version of this map all laminated and everything. It's about a hundred bucks. I think I'm gonna do that. I want to put this on my wall. So thank you for that suggestion. There is a map of what I wanted and it shows where in the world the mining takes place for uranium, silver, oil. What is this? It's kind of hard to read. Cold, gold, platinum, chromium, nickel, lead, zinc, copper, manganese, uranium, silver, oil. What is this? It's kind of hard to read. Cold, gold, platinum, chromium, nickel, lead, zinc, copper, manganese, titanium, tin. Is that iron? I don't know. I'm looking at a kind of a low res preview version. Anyway, it's obviously very useful. And there was a meme I saw earlier today. It said that leftists believe that mining for coal is bad. Bad, bad, bad. Can't mine for coal. You know, because fossil fuels and everything. Instead, we got to mine for lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper, manganese, aluminum, zinc. We have to mine like 15 minerals instead of coal. So now we have all these mines all over the world, of course, only in places that most Americans don't see hidden away in third world nations and collapsed corrupt regimes like the Democratic Republic of Congo and what have you. You don't see those mines. Mining for coal in your own backyard, you know, that's bad, but mining for 15 minerals at slave labor wages around the world in corrupt regimes, oh, that's okay, because it's green, apparently, you know. Interesting, isn't it? How they have to be selectively blind to what it takes to mine for all these minerals that create a green economy. It turns out there's a dirty little secret behind green. I mean, it is dirty, it is corrupt, it is unsustainable, it is environmentally toxic, if you think about it. It's expensive. And also, I was listening to another audiobook of a pretty in-depth analysis of fossil fuel infrastructure versus green energy infrastructure. And this author made a really great point. He said that fossil fuel infrastructure to deliver energy and green energy infrastructure, they cost about the same over time to deliver kilowatt hours or horsepower or what have you. The cost is about the same, except the fossil fuel infrastructure requires very little investment up front. And it's kind of a pay as you go, whereas green energy requires almost all the investment up front, massive capital requirements up front with relatively little payment over time. For example, you've got to spend a fortune to build a wind turbine, but from that point forward, the wind is basically free, right? Or you have to spend a fortune to build solar panels, but then they produce energy for 20 years or whatever, essentially for free. So the green energy infrastructure is extremely capital intensive, capital intensive. And since capital, i.e. loans and money creation is now in a global contraction phase, especially with the Fed raising interest rates, which is going to continue, and a lot of loans failing, and a lot of countries like China being overly indebted, we're going to see the destruction of easy capital around the world for the next probably decade or maybe generation. And that's going to mean there won't be much capital available for green energy projects which are very capital intensive up front. And so a lot of countries are going to revert to doing what is affordable and simple and kind of cheap to start, which is digging up coal and burning coal. In a coal-fired power plant, it's local. It's local energy. It doesn't require long global supply chains. It's cheap and it can scale. People use more electricity, you just shovel more coal into the oven, you know? I mean, not literally shovel, but you get the idea. You can scale it. You can't scale wind farms, not on demand. You can't scale solar power on demand. You can't scream at the sky. Sun shine brighter right now because more people are using air conditioning. Doesn't work that way. But coal, you can just burn more. Seriously. So the green energy infrastructure is a dirty, dirty business, it turns out. But let's talk about the 20-minute neighborhoods here and kind of get that out of the way. There was a great article about that by Rhoda Wilson at the Expo Zay, which is expose-news.com. Scotland's plan to implement 20-minute neighborhoods nationwide. And this article goes on to talk about these essentially globalist plans, the UN's sustainable goals and so on. And they want to develop these neighborhoods where everything that a typical person would need is within 20 minutes of walking distance, you know, employment, shopping, healthcare services, schools, playgrounds, and toilets, too. Housing, even public transportation, if you need to go somewhere else, you know, go into the city for something. But 20 minutes is all they really want you to have access to 20 walking minutes away from where you live. And they don't want you to have cars. In fact, they keep talking about how people shouldn't have cars and how they're going to outlaw combustion engine cars. And that way they can tie your electric car to the grid, which they control and they can shut off your wattage to your house, for example, or even if you pay for charging at a charging station using a credit card or using a central bank digital currency wallet or a biometric ID, they can say, oh, you're not allowed to have more juice for your car, you've driven too many miles. So there's this, this 20 minute city or 20 minute neighborhood concept, which is essentially it's a, it's a prison system. It's locking you down into your hunger games sector, basically, you know, you know, sector 12 and you have to stay within that sector and you're not allowed to have a car because that would be bad. That wouldn't be green. And then you're supposed to survive on everything in that sector, which is going to be kind of like a Truman show where everything's tightly controlled. Like this is the bank you have to use. This is a grocery store where you have to get groceries. These are the schools where you have to get your children indoctrinated and so on. This is where you go to vote, not that it matters, because it's all rigged, and so on. And this concept is part of the climate change or the climate lockdown prison planet concept, turning the cities of the world into climate prison camps. This is what the WEF wants. As you know, the WEF, the World Economic Forum, is that where it is? Started their meeting this week. Some strange things have been happening there, by the way. First of all, Klaus Schwab and George Soros both announced that they were no longer going to attend at first. Then I think one of them showed up anyway. But of all the attendees that were supposed to be there, something like half or more did not show up on the first day, Monday. So there's a lot of speculation. I don't have the answers to this, but a lot of people were speculating that Klaus Schwab and George Soros were not going to show up because they were afraid of being arrested perhaps, or they were afraid of a bombing or a false flag event and some kind of security event. Hey, didn't they have 5,000 armed soldiers guarding this thing? Pretty sure that was announced last week. 5,000 military personnel to guard the WEF. That makes you wonder WTF doesn't it? Well, like what were they expecting? Well, apparently they're all flipping out and I'm just wondering is there some is there some positive pro human force in the world that's trying to arrest these people and hold them accountable for their crimes against humanity? I don't know. And we kind of hope that's the case. for their crimes against humanity? I don't know. And we kind of hope that's the case. A friend was texting me also some information today about the fact that the vehicles that are being used to drive WEF members to the event, you know, back and forth from the hotel to the event, all of those vehicles are required to be combustion engine vehicles. Why? Because the WEFers, combustion engine vehicles. Why? Because the WEFers, they don't want to get stalled out in an electric vehicle where they might be a sitting duck for, you know, who knows what, arrests or attacks or false flags or who knows what. So think about it. We talked about yesterday how the private jet pilots that are being hired to fly people to this Davos event, those pilots are required to be unvaccinated. They have to be purebloods to fly the planes because that's safer. And then the vehicles have to be combustion engines because, well, that's more reliable. Meanwhile, these people are telling you, oh, you fly in a plane with vaccinated pilots, you know, because it's the public. You drive an electric vehicle and get stranded in a snow pilots, you know, because it's the public. You drive an electric vehicle and get stranded in a snowstorm, you know. Good luck. You know, you have to live within a 20 minute neighborhood and walk around to conserve your carbon footprint while they, the globalists, fly around on these jets just streaming, you know, contrails across the sky with all their carbon emissions, right? And of course, they're probably enjoying, you know, rare steaks and cuisine, you know, animal products and whatever. And while telling you, eat mealworms and black soldier fly larvae, you know, eat cricket McNuggets. It's like, these people are so hated by the world now because we're long past the day when the media could pull off claiming, oh, there's no meeting in Davos. It's all a conspiracy theory. Remember when they were for years, they said that Alex Jones was making it up. There's no Bilderberger group. You know, there's no secret meeting. There's no globalism. There's no one world government agenda. Remember those years? And then sometime in the last few years they just shifted and said, oh yeah, all that's true, but you will own nothing and be happy. You should love the fact that globalists are in charge. So no apologies to Alex Jones and all of that for being correct, 20 years in advance, by the way. But now they just shove it in your face. They're like, we're going to fly around on private jets and eat well and eat hamburgers and you know, steaks and whatever. But you're going to live in poverty and you're going to be in lockdown in your 20 minute neighborhood. No cars for you, no meat for you. Oh, you know what? In fact, I want to talk about this pure blood beef. So I live in cattle country in rural Texas. And if you know anything about cattle, you know that the genetics of cattle are extremely, extremely valuable. There's a whole industry of collecting bull semen and selling it, you know, based on the genetics, you know the line of the bulls and you know impregnating the cows to have the right offspring and everything. Obviously, this is a massive multi-million dollar business. Bullsemen, yeah. Well, what happens when they start injecting all these cattle with mRNA injections? Because we already have the science papers that show that the spike protein goes into the semen, doesn't it? And then the spike protein causes artificial clotting or induces clotting, and it causes what? Oh, stillbirths and infertility and an inability to have viable offspring. So do you realize that if they start injecting these million dollar bulls, like Mr. Bullseaman there, start injecting him with mRNA, his once valuable golden seaman now becomes spike protein semen which will cause infertility and spontaneous abortions and stillbirths in Whatever cow he is impregnating you see and it's not going to take farmers and ranchers very long to realize Hey, all the cows we injected are dying Because that costs them money. It's not like in the human populations where they can just cover it up as a oh It's just a coincidence. No when it comes to ranchers like we're losing money What is happening here? Why are all the cows dying suddenly you see? Why are there so many stillbirths? Why is the mama dying during childbirth or giving birth to a a dead baby cow? They're gonna figure this out quickly, but by the time they do a Lot of these ranchers are going to, it's going to be too late. The bull semen is ruined. Why? Because the bull now has been infested or infected with mRNA, reverse transcriptase, chromosomal alterations. iterations, that semen just went from the golden goose of abundance to trash semen, useless, zero value. And I believe that just as we have a market right now for pure blood, human blood for blood banks and transfusions and such, I believe we're gonna see the emergence of a marketplace of unvaccinated, i.e. pure blood cows, bulls. Bullsemin that is not infected with mRNA, it's a pure blood line. So those of you listening who are ranchers, if you're involved in this industry, I want you to keep this in mind that the lineage from your super special prize bull will have incredible value if you have a pure blood bull, whereas those who vaccinate them with mRNA are going to have compromised bull semen, which is worthless. Nobody wants compromised bullsemen, it turns out. And now, the other takeaway from this is realizing that just as mRNA injections are designed to achieve human depopulation, well mRNA injections into ranch animals, it's designed to achieve, of course, depopulation of ranch animals. So you look at countries like the Netherlands, and they said they're going to shut down, what, 3,000 ranch farms, ranch operations, cattle, sheep, I don't know, what else, chickens, everything, meat animals, hogs, you name it. They're shutting it all down, essentially a gunpoint. And you recall they were saying, because, produce too much nitrogen you know from urinating and things like that. Because you know urine contains nitrogen. Well what if these mRNA injections are genocide against ranch animals? Just just as it's genocide against humanity. So they're trying to depopulate humans and they're trying to depopulate, well, beef animals and cows because they don't want you to be able to eat beef because they say that cows are bad for the environment. So bad. It would be so much better to have mealworms from a mealworm factory. You remember what I mentioned yesterday out of that study, something like mealworms, 140th of the ecological footprint of cows? Okay. Except that cows can operate on essentially near useless land. You can unleash cows on some scrub land in Nevada or Utah or even parts of Arizona, New Mexico, West Texas, you know, Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, cows can turn useless land into actual food source and they walk around and gather up the food themselves. Mealworms can't do that. If you unleash a bunch of mealworms in the near desert conditions of Nevada, you're just going to have a bunch of dead mealworms. So when they say, oh, mealworms use less space and mealworms have less ecological footprint, it's nonsense. Cows are using space that can't be used for almost anything else. That's one thing cows are really, really good at, by the way, is turning useless land into something that's valuable. Don't you love how these globalists, these insect food corporations always brag about how ecologically sound their tasteless garbage is? And the more gross the food becomes, the more they proclaim all these savings. Like, well, if you eat crickets, you know, it uses only one-tenth the footprint of beef. Okay, start eating crickets. If you eat mealworms, it's one-twentieth. And if you eat this totally gross bacteria slime, it uses one-fiftieth, the ecological footprint of cows. And you know, where do they go with this? If you just eat dirt, it's one 1,000th. Just go out and eat dirt, man. I mean, is this a selling point? The more gross it is, the more green it's supposed to be. It's like, and if you eat each other, it saves the whole plant. That's where it's going. Like if you just eat each other, then just skip right past the crickets, black larva the mealworms the grubs the bacteria just eat each other You know save the planet eat your neighbor and something like that I can only imagine that in these 20 minute neighborhoods It's also gonna be like 20 minutes of range 10 minutes to cannibalism It's like you're within 20 minutes of finding another human to eat at any given time. It'd be like escape from New York, you know, can you make it out of the 20 minute zone before your neighbor has you for barbecue? You know, it'd be like I've been eating them mealworms for far too long and getting a hankering for some ribs. Looking mad at juicy there. Yeah, it's gonna get crazy, trust me. You can only eat mealworms for so long before people snap. Oh, and by the way, you're gonna love this, wait till you see these photos. I took some ground up cricket meal powder to the lab. And I've got a microscopy expert that is doing the photography of these for me. But I did an initial view of what is in there. Wait till you see these photos, because in the ground up cricket meal powder, which is supposed to be this, you know, super high protein powder. It's good for you. Under the microscope, you can see like chopped up cricket legs and and the little cricket hairs, little black cricket hairs or segments of cricket hairs. So in and amidst all the chitin that's in there which look like brown pebbles or something, little brown chunks, there's an occasional like part of an eyeball or something, there's an occasional semi-transparent possible cellulose, I don't know what it is, and then there's these cricket leg pieces. It's all in there and And you're going to see these photos. I can't wait to show you. And they freaked me out. But we're doing that. And I just bought some dried mealworms too, because, well, we should look at those up close, I think. Since you're going to be eating them, well, maybe not you in particular, but the people, the same people who took the vaccine shots, I guess, will be living on mealworms soon, so they should meet their food up close and personal. Okay, we're going to get to the anti-clotting solutions or the anti-spike protein solutions here in a second. Want to mention a couple of things. There is a 10% off discount code at the satellite phone store, not for the services, not for the sat phone services, but for the EcoFlow products, which are the solar generators and the solar panels and anything like that, the physical products, they've got 10% off for the rest of this month. Use discount code, MIC2023. I didn't make that up. They did just altogether no space. Mike 2023, save 10% at sat123.com. And again, and they've got the off grid solar generators, you know, the power banks that can help you during a power outage. And then of course, watch the special that I mentioned earlier, grid down what now that's coming out. Anyway, it's, it's rare to have a savings coupon from the satellite phone store. So I thought I would share that. Now, moving on to the world of academia, did you know there's a Colorado college professor who says that the study of astrophysics is racist? Now, notice I didn't say the field of astrophysics because the University of Southern California says the word field is anti-immigrant. Remember that? You can't say you're in the field of astrophysics. Oh, you're racist. You're anti-immigrant. But it turns out astrophysics is racist due to the emphasis on individualism and exceptionalism. And there was an article about this by Jonathan Turley, citing a professor, Natalie Gosnell, who says that astrophysics is a racist field. And one of the quotes from that professor is a quote, as an astrophysicist, I'm a product of institutions that are steeped in systemic racism and white supremacy, the tenants of white supremacy that show up in physics that's in brackets of individualism and exceptionalism and perfectionism, in other words, you know, getting the right answer. It's either or thinking and there's no subtlety, there's no gray area. She believes, Professor Gosnell believes that metaph metaphors reflect a violent and hypermasculine bias. So you're not supposed to use metaphors like the Big Bang Theory. That's masculine. It might be like a cosmic raping or something. The Big Bang Theory. Yeah. Think about it. Hmm. It's cited, she cites the violent hypermas lens of the quote vampire star and the cannibal star See, I told you cannibalism was going to factor into this. It's not just the 20 minute neighborhoods It's the whole cosmos cannibal stars But remember how we've been told that philosophy is racist because so many of the historical philosophers were quote white, which isn't even true. Many of them were European, which would make them immigrants if they showed up in America, right? And we're told that the history of math is racist, because for the same reason, too many white people involved in mathematics. Are you serious? What about the the inception of mathematics? Didn't it come from the Middle East? Did it not? People that we might call today Persians, Iranians, Iraqi people? I mean, wasn't that the dawn of modern mathematics and geometry, but somehow math is racist. I mean, these people have no clue what they're talking about. It's just like yesterday, they were talking about the LAPD, you know, the police chief saying, you can't have the thin blue line flags because that's racist, but half the police officers in Los Angeles are Hispanic or Latino. It's like these, these people claiming racism and white supremacy and all this, they literally are, they're insane. They're mentally ill. Why can't we just say that Dr. Martin Luther King was correct? And by the way, I forgot to mention Martin Luther King Day yesterday, so I'll mention it in a belated fashion today, but I believe that Dr. King, were he alive today, would be completely opposed to the hyper insanity, tolerance slash inclusiveness nonsense of the radical left, because it is, it exists in contradiction to what Dr. King taught, which was a meritocracy, right? Judge people by the content of the character, not the color of their skin. Well, the left today is all about judging people on the color of their skin. Or just excluding white people from everything. Did you did you hear that the fake governor of Arizona, Katie Hobs, who stole the election, obviously, fake governor is about to announce $40 million in free education money, but not for white people and not even for Americans. It's only for illegals. It's like, uh, you broke the law, you broke the rules, you came in illegally. Oh here, have some free scholarship money. What, doesn't that money come from Arizona taxpayers? Um, shouldn't it go to the people of Arizona? Or the children of the people of Arizona? Why should Arizona taxpayer money go to illegals who cross the border illegally by definition? But then again, stolen elections have catastrophic consequences. Okay, tell you what, let's shift gears. Let's talk about inactivating SARS-CoV-2, the spike protein and all of that. So I don't know who found this and started circulating this, but whoever it is, I thank you. But this article is actually from the journal known as Viruses, published in March of 2021. And you can find it on researchgate.net and other sites that index research publications. The title is called The Combination of Bromelain and Acetylcystine, which they call Bromac. It's Bromelain plus acetylcystine. Synergistically inactivates SARS-CoV-2. Now, what's interesting to me about this is that these researchers, and I think the lead author is Ahmed Makawi, St. George Hospital, these researchers were actually researching this combination of bromelain and acetylcystine as a cancer treatment because it altered the way the body responds to certain glycoproteins that are, as I understand it, involved in metabolism of cancer cells and so on. And they decided to test this with, essentially, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. And just to wrap it up and keep it really short, although you can go read the research yourself, it turns out that if you use acetylcystine by itself, it does nothing in the context of this. It doesn't stop the spike protein or the envelope proteins. And if you use bromelain by itself, it does very little. But if you combine them, bromelain plus acetylcystine, or as it's sometimes called, NAC, N-acetylcystine, I've heard it pronounced both acetyl and acetyl, so choose whatever way you want. But if you combine these two, then it has a very powerful effect of unfolding the bonds of the elements of the spike protein, thereby inactivating it. From the conclusion of this study, here's what the authors write. BROMAC, which is again bromelain plus acetylcystine, is under clinical development by the authors for musinous cancers due to its ability to alter complex glycoprotein structures. The potential of Bromac on SARS-CoV-2 spike and envelope proteins stabilized by disulfide bonds was examined and found to induce the unfolding of recombinant spike and envelope proteins by reducing disulfide stabilizer bridges. You got that? Basically, this combination of bromelain and acetylcystine comes in and it cuts the knees out from under the molecule that holds the proteins shape together, the spike protein and the envelope proteins. So they go on and they write, BromAC also showed an inhibitory effect on wild type and spike mutant SARS-CoV-2 by inactivation of its replication capacity in vitro. Hence, BromAC may be an effective therapeutic agent for early SARS-CoV-2 infection despite mutations and even have potential as a prophylactic in people at high risk of infection. Now, why did we not hear about this from the media? Anywhere in the media? Well, because these are over-the-counter supplements, you see, over-the-counter supplements. And when you combine this with what I learned from Dr. Brian Ardis also about glycerison, blocking the sort of artificial clotting of fibrinogen in the blood, which by the way causes hepar heparin resistant clots and warfare in resistant clots. Okay, so it's more than just blood clots. These are fibrinogen clots and licorice root extract or glycerin halts this hyper clotting of fibrinogen when exposed to venom peptides, right? So these three things that we're talking about today, glycerycin from licorice root, bromelain, which you can buy over the counter, probably at any Walgreens or Amazon or anywhere, and acetylsistine or NAC as it's sold. You can get NAC from, I don't know, lots of places. These three things, according to the science papers, may show effects that we should have known about. Things that should have been studied further, maybe they were studied more, but I haven't heard about it. And the media never told people about any of this and in an age Where people are dying from clots, you know, and and they're dying from the I guess the effects of the inflammation of spike protein and People are they've been turned into spike protein factories and some people are shedding spike protein Shouldn't we know about anti shedding? Technologies or solutions or supplements or molecules or anything? I mean, this is a shedding shield, you could say. Shouldn't we know about these things? Shouldn't this have been talked about? But of course, no, nothing. You weren't allowed to talk about anything other than just the vaccine. Take the vaccine, take the booster. Don't you dare do anything else. You can't drink water. Don't take vitamin C. Don't even think about zinc. Nothing. Vaccines, vaccines, vaccines. And then we come to find the vaccines don't work, obviously. The vaccines are killing people. But the media still isn't reporting, you know, bromelain and acetylcystine and Licorice root or glycerycin isn't that interesting no surprise By the way, I take bromelain anyway. I take in acetylcystine anyway. I Mean in AC is one of the supplements I routinely take because it has so many supportive benefits and months I routinely take because it has so many supportive benefits. And licorice root is not something that I always take because, well, licorice root can have lead in it, so you have to get a trusted source of it. And so I don't load up on licorice root, but believe me, I'm going to start taking more now knowing this. And maybe the bromelain I've been taking is part of the reason why you know I've been interacting with so many people and have not been afflicted with any of this. I mean I've had a few a couple of times where I was symptomatic for a few days and so I rested more, I slept more and I beat it you know but I haven't been hospitalized or bedridden or just completely destroyed. No, never happened. I never lost my sense of smell or taste or hearing or any of these other symptoms that a lot of people did experience because of the bio weapons infections and the shedding and so on. And you know, I take also quercetin and I take zinc and I take vitamin D and I take all these things that I believe help support the body's natural immune response to any kind of external threats of any kind in a very broad sense. And more and more, the scientific literature keeps reaching the same conclusion. We turn out, yeah, it's smart to do these things and support your natural immune response and support natural blood flow. Keep your blood healthy and your body's going to be healthy because every living cell in your body is reached by your blood. Keep your blood healthy and even your brain is going to work better too. And then also avoid toxic exposures. Like don't hang around with friends who are full of spike protein. Don't have sex with vaccinated people. And don't handle spike protein bullsemen for God's sake. right? It's not a good thing. Protect yourself from toxic exposures. And you will be all the healthier as a result. All right, now, by the way, since this is a knowledge-based podcast, I'm going to introduce you all, or y'all, to a new word. You'll understand why I said that. If you've not heard this word, you're going to love this one. The word is l-a-r-a-p-i-n. Now, if you know this word, if you've ever heard it used in the context of describing delicious food, then you are probably a southerner because I heard some members of my family use this when I was a youngin', and they would say things like, that was laripin good. And I remembered that word when I was thinking about it lately, it's like, what does laripin actually mean? So if you go online and you look up sort of crowdsource definitions of laripin, I wanna share this with you, because if you ever find yourself eating something, especially a southern dish that is really good in a home cooked kind of way, you can say that was larypin good. It's an adjective and it's according to these crowdsource definitions, you can use it to describe a peach cobbler, ribs, gravy and biscuits. Quote, should be noted this is a Midwestern and Southern term commonly used to describe tasty po-folk foods. Northerners don't have anything that's larypin, so see, all you northerners you've been missing out on the larypin. Common usage, quote, damn biscuits was larypin. Also, food's so good it would make you slap yo' papi. It means it's over the top in terms of good flavor usage. That sausage gravy made those biscuits larepin. The vanilla ice cream was larepin. On the peach cobbler. No, collard greens could never be larepin. Just in case you were wondering. That roast beef and sauce and garden vegetables and that vanilla ice cream were just larypin. And the cornbread and the gravy were larypin too. The whole meal was just larypin. See, I was at Big Mama's house and she done cooked some pinto beans and cornbread. We gobbled up the bread and then beans was larypin good. All right, there you go. Just giving you more examples. So you can now, you can spread the southern good times using the word lerapean. But it's got to be a southern, a southern meal, folks. You can't have some northern food. You can't have like some Canadian dish. And that's lerapean. No, that's that's Canadian. This has got to be a Southern dish. It's got to be cornbread, okra, black-eyed peas, catfish, something like that. That could be larypin, but only if it's really tasty. And just in case you're wondering, crickets can never be larypin. And mealworm, beetle, beef patties, those are not larypin for sure. And what, the black soldier fly larva dipping sauce, that's not larepin, that's just gross. So I think that since actual good southern food is disappearing because of all these attacks on the meat supply and you're not gonna get like actual meat gravy any longer, you're not gonna get actual actual meat gravy any longer. You're not gonna get actual sausage, like breakfast sausage cooked up and all its grease comes out. And then your grandma takes the sausage patties out of the pan and uses the grease to make the gravy by adding some flour and some pepper and so on. You're not gonna get that anymore. Nothing's gonna be larypin. It's just gonna be gross. These crunchy, kickin' legs, it's to be larypin. It's just going to be gross. These crunchy kick-it legs, definitely not larypin. All right, now, talking about food, let's talk about food sabotage because Dr. Andrew Huff, who is the whistleblower formerly of EcoHealth Alliance, and he's the author of a book that we're going to talk about later this week, by the way. He was on with Emerald Robinson and in that video, he mentioned that the food infrastructure attacks, he believes are being coordinated by the United States government. This was written up by Rare Foundation, r-a-i-R, rarefoundation.com and some other websites, talking about how 200 food factories or facilities have been attacked around the world, mostly in the United States. The Dr. Huff has analyzed the attacks. He said that the attacks matched the most critical systems in his data set. He reported this to the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI, but he never received a response. So what data set is he talking about? It's the US Department of Homeland Security's food and agricultural sector criticality assessment tool known as Fast Cat. Yeah, there's your acronym Fast Cat. Fast cat. Yeah, there's your acronym, Fast Cat. And this tool indicates which places are particularly high risk for attacks because they are critical, they're necessary for the food infrastructure to function. And it's almost as if this Homeland Security database was used as like a list of attacks or priority attacks. It's like the list was a target list basically is I think what he's saying. So, so much of what's happening in the world right now, we're told is just a coincidence. You know, all these 50 athletes dropping dead on live TV, it's a coincidence, it's just happening now. It's just what a coincidence. All these food facilities going up in flames and it's another coincidence. All this radical weather that's destroying the food supply, you know, suddenly it's it's rain storms all over California and then it's drought, drought, drought, and then rain and storms. And it cold freezes wiping out the winter wheat, wiping out the citrus crops. So another coincidence. Folks, these are not coinc crops. So another coincidence. Folks, these are not coincidences. These are plans. This is the dismantling, the controlled demolition of the food infrastructure. And as you know, they want to start people into, well, desperation and famine, and essentially depopulation to the point where you're going to think that eating mealworms and crickets is pretty tasty. Does cricket protein bars lappin' good? No, I don't think so. Now on a slightly different topic here, 90% of online content could be generated by AI systems by the year 2025. That's not very far away. And this is from Yahoo Finance, by the way. Generative AI systems like the OpenAI Chat GPT, it says, could completely revamp how digital content is developed, says Nina Schick. She is apparently an AI thought leader, which is an interesting title, artificial intelligence thought leader. She says, I think we might reach 90% of online content generated by AI by 2025. So this technology is exponential. You see chat GPT, but there are a whole plethora of other platforms and applications that are coming up. And she explains that generative AI can create content across all forms of media, text, video, audio, pictures, every digital media. And it is known to now be able to create new things that would previously have been seen as unique to human intelligence or human creativity. And there was a new story last week that said this new Microsoft system can scan your voice or just listen to your voice for three seconds. And from that, it can mimic your voice and have you say anything. And of course, these AI systems can read your articles and then they can write like you. So they can sound like you, they can sound like you, they can write like you pretty soon, they'll have videos where they can just look like you. I know they have deep fakes, but it'll be automated soon with AI systems. And I just realized, you know, my work will live forever. It's like any of us who are content creators, right? Our work can live forever. At some point, we can just retire and put the avatar in there. Yeah, boom, sound like the health ranger. I mean, I say that kind of satirically, of course, because what these AI systems cannot do is ever be actually human. And they lack the creativity that we have. I mean, they can kind of simulate a person. They can sort of trick people into thinking that they sound like you or look like you or write like you, but they can't actually think like those of us who are the free thinkers. You know, like those of you listening to this, we are the free thinkers, we are the boundary busters of society. Not only do we think outside the box, we don't even believe in the existence of the box. What box? We're not in a box. We just bust through all those barriers and we can have concepts about anything. AI systems cannot do that. They can just mimic human intelligence, but they cannot actually exhibit human intelligence. So I think that AI systems will replace, by the way, all those talking heads script readers in the corporate media. Who needs them? They're just actors anyway. They're reading teleprompters. They're performers. And a lot of them are kind of low IQ, by the way. They're just performers who have a certain look, a certain voice and a certain delivery. You don't need humans to do that. Same thing with pill pimping doctors. You don't need a human doctor to push pills. It'll be a glorified pharmaceutical vending machine. Real doctors, i.e. nature of paths, alternative medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, complementary doctors, energy medicine, what have you, real doctors, real like healers and educators. You can't script what they do, because they are outside the box thinkers, they are holistic thinkers, they connect dots that the machine doesn't even know exist. You see? Same thing is true about generating content, a podcast like this, a health ranger podcast that I hope you are enjoying can never be recreated by an AI system. I mean, they can fake it, they can simulate it, they can sound like me, but they can't think like me because well, I'm unpredictable. I mean, I have a certain style, but on any given day, you don't know what's gonna happen. Might be a song, right? Might be jokes, might be voice impersonations, might be news, might be science, might, who knows? You don't know, nobody knows, I don't even know half the time. You can't fake that with an AI system. Yeah, they can replace customer service, they can answer questions, you know, what are your frequently asked questions that they can do these simple tasks, they can fill out legal forms, they can write financial articles today, the stock market rose 2.7%. They can do sports reporting. The Indians were ahead and now they're no longer even the Indians because of political correctness. But they can't replace real human beings, which I think is great because it emphasizes the importance of being fully human. So if you're a human being and you're locked into a career or a habit that just turns you into a robot where you're just rubber stamping paperwork all day. You know, you're just a machine anyway. You're a human pretending to be a machine. Well, machines can be better machines than humans can. So this is an invitation to be something more than a machine, to be fully human, to express your full humanity, your full creativity. The more AI comes along, the more valuable it's going to be to be a free thinker. So yeah, our AI system is going to write a bunch of web pages. Of course they are, they're going to write marketing materials. Yeah, sure. They're going to do robot paintings and whatever, already doing that. You got that DAO-E system that creates artwork. You just tell it what I want, you know, and it creates artwork for you in whatever style you want. Sure. It's just a novelty. It doesn't mean anything. But the larger truth is that AI systems can never be your God. Now, of course, the globalists and the transhumanists think that AI systems are going to be their gods, right? And that's where they're wrong. But in reality, an AI system can never replace Christ, can never replace the Creator, can never even begin to experience or understand what it is to have a soul, right? To have consciousness, to live with a sense of self, a first person perspective of life via, I think, therefore I am that that recognition of self is something that AI can never have, although it can try to simulate it. So yeah, we're going to live in a world of all kinds of AI systems and we're going to have, you know, AI driven cars eventually that won't crash into things, that might even be able to park without crashing into other parked cars, what have you. without crashing into other parked cars, what have you. I've seen some crazy videos of Tesla doing weird things on autopilot, like blazing through the streets of China running over and killing people. It's crazy. Yeah, runaway AI systems, but AI has got to take over a lot of mundane jobs and that's just more encouragement to do something that is not mundane. So I say the correct way to observe AI is to look at it and let it serve as a reminder that it's important that we live lives with a pro-human purpose, that we do something that matters, something meaningful, something that rises above the machines. The machines are becoming more and more sophisticated. And again, they can simulate life, but they cannot replace it. They cannot even feel it. They can't understand it. They can't experience it. And they can never, ever replace your creator or the ultimate gift of life that you and I have received. So it's going to be amusing to watch the AI systems try to try to simulate human beings, but it's just going to be all the more reason for those of us who are truly fully human. They're expressing our humanity in the greatest ways to double down on that, right? And to go even further in that arena of understanding the purpose of being here, what it means to be human, what it means to share that the connection of purpose with others. This is what we can learn from AI development, by the way, not to be impressed with AI, but to be reminded of who we are. And to all those AI scientists who think they're going to find God in the ghost of the machine? They're going to be in for a big surprise. There's no God in there. You're going to have to look elsewhere to find God. Yeah, we were opening up the microchips to try to find the little gods inside. Couldn't find not one of them. They're not in there, turns out. They're little transistor gods. It's a bunch of nonsense. See what I mean? Let's see if AI can ever come up with just spontaneous stuff like that. Never gonna happen, folks. Gotta be human, gotta be creative, gotta be, you know, given the gift of life by God, gotta have that conscious connection with whatever else is beyond this realm. That's for sure. Connection with God. That's what makes us human. It's not lines of code. All right, so with that said, we're gonna jump into the interview with Daisy Luther from the Organic Prepper.

Thank you for joining me and we'll be back with you tomorrow. Take care. All right. Welcome to today's featured interview. And I can't believe that I have never done an official interview with this person because her website and her work and her influence has been so critical over the years for preppers and for people being aware of what's going on. And I'm a fan of her work and her website and her other writers as well. Her name is Daisy Luther, organicpreppers.com and also thefrugalite.com, which we'll talk about here. Daisy Luther, it's just fantastic to have you on. I can't believe we've never done an interview before. I'm a fan. Welcome to the show. Thank you. I'm so happy to be here. Well, I'm just thrilled to have you here. You've done just extraordinary work for many years. Can I ask you when? When was organic preppers comm first launched? I Launched the organic prepper comm actually it started off as the organic prepper dot CA. I lived in Canada when we first started back in 2012 and In 2013 when I moved to the US, I changed it to theorganicprepper.com. Oh, I'm sorry. I mistakenly said the wrong URL. Oh, that's okay. But that's what I meant, theorganicprepper.com. Thank you. No problem. But it did start out as a Canadian website and then, you know, just kind of brought it with me. So I've been doing this since 2012. Well, that's fantastic. You've done a lot of great reporting. You've had a lot of bombshell stories. You've broken a lot of news over the years. And I think you've helped a lot of people. And then your newer site, I think it's newer, thefrugalight.com tells about that because I think it is really going to help people navigate what's coming. That is a new website and our tagline on that site is living large on a tiny budget. A lot of frugal living websites are, they're very sad, you know? It seems like a lot of work and it seems like you never get to have any fun. It just seems like it's all about deprivation. This website, of course, there are times that you really do have to cut back and change the way you're living, but it doesn't have to be miserable or dismal. You can still have lots of fun with your kids. You can still go on vacation. You can still occasionally eat out and you know, just enjoy your life. It's just all about how you budget your money and how you save in places that you know, maybe don't affect your quality of life as much. Yeah, absolutely. In fact, I'd love to talk to you a little bit here about frugal living. This is something I've advocated as well and I'd like to point to you a little bit here about frugal living. This is something I've advocated as well. And I'd like to point out right up front that actually frugal living over the long run becomes more abundant living because there's no faster way to become poor than to overspend. Absolutely. I agree with you completely. When I first really, really went on a major frugal living overhaul, I was in debt. I had lost my house and my car. And just a whole bunch of things had gone wrong. And when everything went belly up in 2008, I worked in the automotive industry. And so by 2009, 2010, I had lost my job. So the the house of cards really collapsed when I lost my job. And, you know, getting that under control and living frugally was just such a leap into freedom. I mean, it didn't start out as a whole lot of fun, you know, because I had to change my daughter's school. I had to make enormous changes. But once we got used to it, and once we really got the hang of it, we were just living so much better than we were before. Oh, I can see that. A big thing with that was I had more time to spend with my children. There you go. And that's, you can't put a price on that. Absolutely. We live in a culture, as you well know, that is so focused on materialism. And especially across social media. And this is true across all age groups, but perhaps more so with younger people. They tend to define themselves by the stuff that they can show on camera to show that they're living the life. Especially I've noticed a lot of young men, they wanna have these really fancy cars, and they wanna have lots of them for some reason. I never understood what's the point in any of that. But young women often, you know, at least the mainstream ones, they want to have the fashion purses and the vacations and the fashion clothes and everything. And, you know, there is no faster way to poverty than to just spend, spend, spend, trying to impress your friends. Exactly, exactly. You know, my daughters were brought up, we didn't have a lot of money when they were little. And then when we did have more money, we were still pretty careful with it. And they are 22 and 27, and they are the most down to earth young women. We get together at Christmas, and most of our gifts are handmade and we cook together. And, you know, we just focus so much more on experiences and spending time together. And I'm just so proud of how they turned out. Well, that's amazing to hear that. And I'm sure that what you do has been strongly influential in what they do. But let me ask you this question. Can you share with us? I'm sorry to put you on the spot, but share with us if you would. And I'll share also a story, a personal story from you or your family about frugality. It doesn't have to be a crazy thing, but it could be something quite sensical. But have you experienced something that you'd be willing to share publicly about Frugal Living or something that your family did to save money? Sure. I mean, I can think of a lot of things. This isn't so much about saving money, but it's about mindset. When we were really, really broke, when we lost the house and the car and all of the other stuff, you know, I mean, it was a horrible time for us. It was incredibly difficult for the girls. They had to move away from their friends and lose their room and all that kind of stuff. But every week when we went to the grocery store, I had a very limited budget, about $30 a week. But I pulled aside $2, one for each girl, and one of them got to buy a package of pasta, and one got to buy a package of spaghetti sauce. And there was a bin at the door as you left the grocery store, and that was for the food bank. And every time, they put so much thought and so much effort into what they were choosing to put in that bin because I told them, you know, you're buying somebody a meal right now. With this dollar apiece, you are making sure that somebody somewhere has a hot meal. And, you know, they're gonna go to bed with full tummies and it's because of what you did is because of your decisions so choose really carefully something that'll be really good and they would spend you know 15 or 20 minutes getting exactly the right sauce you know the right canned sauce to go with the the bag of pasta And it was important because they knew that even though things were tough for us, there were people who had it worse than we did and that they had within them the capacity to help. And I think that is such an important lesson that we all have the capacity to help others. Oh yeah, absolutely. That's well stated. I'll share a memory. My grandparents grew up during the Great Depression and at one point they lived in a tent. It was a work tent. There was a company that my grandfather worked for and all the employees were given space in a field to set up a tent. So they would work, save the money, and just live in a tent for a while. And when I was a kid, growing up in the 70s, I was very wasteful, relatively wasteful, because here we are in the 70s, pretty abundant time era in terms of stuff. I would leave lights on all the time. My grandmother and grandfather would go behind me. Anytime I moved around their house, I'd leave lights on, they would turn the lights off. I asked them, why do you keep turning off all the lights? That's when they told me about living in the tent and saving old inner tubes from bicycle tires in case you needed to repair a pair of shoes and things like that. They told me great depression stories and my jaw dropped. It was the first time I got an idea of what it was like to live poor, but it changed my perception and that's when I started to turn off lights. Absolutely. I grew up. My father was a doctor, so I never ever experienced any kind of poverty or any kind of shortage of money when I was growing up. So it was really, really different for my children than it was for me. You know, it was just a completely different circumstance. And I have to say that in a lot of ways, I think that they were better prepared for adult life than I was because I didn't really know how to handle money or how to be thrifty or how to be careful or how to make a budget, you know, because everything had been handed to me. And that's certainly not a criticism of my parents because, you know, my dad was a great provider, but we didn't end up in that situation. And I think that my girls handled the transition to adulthood a whole lot better because of the experiences. And but also because I was open with them about our financial situation. I know a lot of people don't like to talk to their kids about money. And I think that is a tremendous mistake. I think that the whole family has to be on board. If you are embarking on a lifestyle of frugality and you're making the changes that we all need to be making right now to handle the economic situation in the United States and a lot of the Western world. The whole family has to be on board. And if your kids have no idea what it's like to pay bills and they have no idea, you know, we have this little formula of how much mom has to work to pay for X item that one of the girls wanted. And I would say, well, you know, you want this really, really expensive pair of shoes. And that's gonna take me an entire day for you to get those shoes. And that means that whole way. That's an expensive pair of shoes and that's going to take me an entire day for you to get those shoes and that means that's an expensive pair of shoes. I know well I I mean I wasn't making a ton of money but the whole day you know I'm working a whole day is it really worth that you know we're not paying for anything but your shoes on this day and nine times out of of 10, they would say, yeah, that's too much. And they would rethink it. And yeah, that's great. You know, it's just so important that they understand the connection between the amount of time you spend working and what you're paying for. I love the way you break that down because we live in an age now of stimulus money, free money from the government. And so people have that disconnect. They no longer understand that money is supposed to be a product of effort or savings or investment, let's say, but to have the money to invest, you have to start by working and saving. And that idea is largely lost on people. And by the way, I think also during the whole crypto bubble, which has since burst, I think the crypto coins taught a generation, especially of young men, at least this is what I've observed, that they don't have to work to become incredibly wealthy. They just have to keep buying whatever coin it is. And I think that was a horrible lesson for this generation. I agree completely. You know, you can work in a creative field, you can work in all sorts of fields, but you have to actually work. Yeah. Yeah, right, you need to produce something or contribute to the community or the economy. Exactly. Exactly. And, you know, I think that it's going to end up going back to that because there's not really going to be an option. Completely agree. I think that you are ahead of the curve, Daisy. What you're doing with the Frugalite, and again, I love that website name. That's pretty cool. I think you're so far ahead of the curve. And I see for the next 10 plus years, people are either going to live in a frugal manner or they're going to find themselves out on the streets very quickly. I saw a meme the other day. It was a photo of a family with kids in a rundown RV. And the kid was saying, my parents lied to me. They told us we were camping. Turns out we're homeless. And it's like you're living in the RV, which a lot more people are needing to do. Right, right. And you know, that just kind of goes back to talk to your kids, get your kids on board, let them know you can do this and you can contribute to the household by doing this thing. Absolutely. Now, okay, here's a question I think our audience is going to ask you. So I'll just throw it out here. How do you balance prepping, i.e., needing to stockpile certain types of things like seeds and food and so on with frugality? I'm sure this is probably the most common balancing act that your audience is faced with. How do you navigate that? I think that they go hand in hand to a great extent because I know that my preps that I've put back, you know, like the grocery store canned goods and, you know, dried goods like rice and beans and things like that have definitely helped me spend less at the grocery store with inflation as it is. So that part of it goes hand in hand. The other way is how you prep. I think the days where we could go out and buy a $10,000 generator for our house just because have come and gone. I don't have a generator. I have a small little solar generator with some solar panels that I can use to charge, you know, some devices or run a fan or something like that. But I don't have like a whole house generator. I don't have lots of fancy equipment. If things go really sideways, I just plan on getting lower and lower tech. And I think that that is really learning those skills where you can live a lot lower tech than you're living right now. I think that is the way that you combine prepping and frugality. Because those low tech things, they use less electricity. So your utility bill will be lower. They don't require as many fancy pieces of equipment. I'm not a gear head. A lot of preppers are really into their gear, but I figure if I have a few guns that work and are well maintained. And I have some ammo. And I have, you know, some food and some seeds that I can kind of make do. Yeah. And I love what you said about low tech. I mean, we are so much on the same page on that I did a, I did an online audiobook called Resilientpping, and it has a chart in there which is high tech, low tech, and no tech solutions for everything. And I completely agree with you because, oh, you may start out with a super high tech solution like your super fancy sewing machine, and then boom, the power grid goes down. So now you need, and I actually bought one of these, a 1959 Singer sewing machine with a hand crank. Oh, I love those. Yeah. I have a pedal one. Yeah, that's even better. But these machines are built like tanks. You can fix them. They have no circuit boards. They have gears, which you can oil, you know, and they're actually more robust, and they run like tanks. I mean, no electricity, no worries. And plus, you're going more robust and they run like tanks. I mean no electricity No worries and plus you're gonna have to fix your pants You can't just go out and buy more pants or buy a new bag or you're gonna have to fix stuff You know, I lived out of a suitcase Twice over the past few years. I went to Europe and I lived in Mexico for a year. And the thing that was most interesting to me was how fast my clothes wore out. Because you know, we're wearing the same things and I didn't, in Europe, I didn't have a car so I walked everywhere. So when you're wearing the same stuff and you've only got two or three pairs of shoes, they wear out pretty darn quick. Yes. Yeah, that's so true. I mean, I'm super active on the ranch. I go through shoes like crazy and I find myself almost, I'm laughing at myself because I'll use a gorilla tape on my shoes for a while to keep them together for the last month. Oh, absolutely. I laugh because my coach used to do that in high school. We used to tease my coach. You're like, coach, you got duct tape, duct tape in your shoes together again. Because he was frugal. You know, we thought it was funny. And then I find I'm doing the same thing. Right, right. Oh, I know. My kids used to joke I looked like a homeless lady because I'm on my farm coat. So funny, yeah. Right, Right. But then again, these are exactly the skills that we're going to need because you learn how to use simple resources to make do. Yes. And just in the nature, in the spirit of the Frugalite website, it doesn't always have to be something ugly like duct tape on your coat. I could put forth a little more effort and I could get out my embroidery thread and I could make the rip in my coat look actually really, really cool if I wanted to do that. And those are the kinds of things that make frugality more palatable to those who might not really be that wild about getting on board. Using creativity and making it fun and personal. Now let's talk about one of the primary benefits of frugality which is getting out of debt. And the debt and you know our audience and your audience are both very sophisticated audiences so they both know debt is enslavement. Debt is also surveillance. Debt means you're tied down. You don't have the freedom because you don't own it free and clear. Right. We live in a society of so much debt and some people brag about it. I've seen these people on YouTube bragging about how they own $200 million worth of homes and their debt is 150 million or more and they brag like this is an accomplishment. I'm like, what? That's crazy, but talk to us about what's your take on freedom from debt and what that means. I am gonna say something that a lot of people disagree with and you may think I'm crazy when I say it. It really depends on your situation whether or not paying off debt should be your priority. Okay, fair enough. If you're in a reasonable situation where you're not at risk of losing your home, you're not at risk of losing the transportation that gets you to and from work. And you have a little bit of money to spare to go to work, credit card debt or whatever debt you happen to find yourself in. Then by all means, I really like the snowball method of Dave Ramsey for getting out of debt. Yes. But right now, a lot of people are not that well off who are in debt. They have been putting their groceries on their credit card because they are stretched beyond all capacity. If you're to the point where you are putting your groceries on your credit card, you're about to get kicked out of your apartment and you're about to lose your car, which is the only way you can get to your job, then paying off debt is not your priority. And I know that every financial expert out there would argue with me, but I'm here to tell you having a roof over your head and a car in your driveway to get back and forth to work is more important than being debt free at that point. If you find yourself at that point, you are better off to call your creditors, call the credit card companies and say, look, I'm really sorry but I cannot pay and I wish I could but I can't. My circumstances have changed because they're gonna ask you, have your circumstances changed since you got the credit card? Yes, my circumstances have changed, I can't make my minimum payment. They will either give you a small payment that you might be able to afford or give you three to six months to not pay anything. And sometimes that is what people need. Like if you can't afford food for your family or you're about to be homeless, then you need to take the opportunity to work on getting a roof over your head and some stability in your life before you attack the debt. You know, I agree with the principle of what you're saying, and I've seen cases where people intentionally go into debt in order to complete some schooling for something like to be a paramedic or to be a physician's assistant or what have you. Some of these are only six or eight weeks or a 12-week course, and then their income doubles after that period, right? It makes total sense to go into debt during that period because you're gonna earn twice as much on the other side of it. And then you can pay off quickly, so I get it. Or even, you know, go into college. When I was in college, I was in a lot of debt. Well, I guess I thought it was a lot at the time, but today it's nothing. But back then I thought it was a ton of debt, and, I guess I thought it was a lot at the time, but today it's nothing. But back then, I thought it was a ton of debt and that makes sense too because you're investing in a skill set. Right. And I'm certainly not telling anyone to go get deliberately into more debt. I'm just saying if you're already in debt and you're at risk of losing absolutely everything, you might need to focus your money on day to day life, like a roof over your head and food in your stomach. Well, right. Right now, because of where we are in the economy, offloading assets is becoming more difficult. For example, real estate prices are suppressed, as you know. And also used vehicle prices are plummeting, I think about 15% year over year right now. And so, I'm sure you would agree that a lot of people got into too much debt because they over, they overspent on perhaps a house or a car that they couldn't afford. Absolutely, but I think some of the debt we're seeing now is for day to day expenses. Like you went to the pharmacy and bought medication for your child using your credit card or You couldn't afford groceries So you put 50 bucks on your credit card or you filled up with gas to get back and forth to work And you put that on your card and that kind of debt. It's really different You know, I mean still has the same outrageous it's really different. You know, I mean, it still has the same outrageous interest rate, but it's really different. I mean, when people are starting to put day-to-day life expenses on credit cards, that's kind of the beginning of the end. And that's exactly where so many Americans are right now. And yes. And those are the people I'm talking to when I say paying that off is not your first priority. Well, and also think about food inflation is not reversing. Now the rate of inflation may be leveling off, but it's still inflation. It's still getting more expensive. And for some food items like eggs, you've seen all the all the memes about eggs, you know, like, you know, like, you know, take her out to eat, show her you love her, buy her something expensive. Oh, it's an omelet, you know. It's things like that. But food's not going to get more affordable that I can see. Well, what's your take on where food prices are going? Well, I don't think it's going to get more affordable. I think that, you know, shopping and season as much as you can, buying locally as much as you can. Those are some of the ways to keep your food costs down. And then of course, raising what you can. I live in an apartment in a city and I kept myself in salad and fresh veggies all summer long just on my little balcony. There you go. So you know, you can grow a little bit anywhere. You can grow stuff indoors. I've got jars of sprouts going right now to add to my salads. Oh yeah. Oh yeah, I've got all these kale plants that just are exploding all over the grow boxes indoors under these grow lights that are really inexpensive to operate. Yeah. And you know, it took me a while to really adapt, but now I really like sprouts and like a salad tastes kind of weird without them. I know what you mean. I, you know, alfalfa is the easiest to taste. Do you, do you get into like broccoli and radish sprouts or some of the more radical tasting stuff? Really, I go with pretty ordinary stuff. It's usually alfalfa. Sometimes it's bean sprouts and I just throw a little handful on my salad every day and you know, it adds nutrition. It's all but free to sprout. And if you're new to sprouting, the website sproutpeople.org, I don't get any money from them. They are just wonderful. They've got so much information. Oh, I completely agree with you. And you know, there's a case where buying, you know, a couple pounds of sprouting seeds, people have no idea how long you can sprout with a couple of pounds of sprouting seeds, people have no idea how long you can sprout with a couple of pounds of sprouting seeds. It's dirt cheap and it's very highly nutritious. Oh, very much so. And think about it's fresh raw food that has the enzymes, it's got the chlorophyll in it, it's got all the vitamins activated by the plants, and you don't need soil, you don't need sunlight. You can sprout in a closet if that's the last place you have. Yes, exactly. It's like the perfect prepper winter food. Yeah, absolutely it is. I'm also thinking, and I want your thoughts on this, that gardening used to be considered by most people kind of like a hobby, even an expensive hobby. But now it seems like the math is changing, where gardening can actually become a money-saving activity compared to some of the prices in the grocery stores. For example, backyard chickens, right? So I have backyard chickens, and I've had them for a decade. I mean, not the exact same chickens, but you know what I mean. And I did it because I just wanted to learn how to do it. And now it's like, wow, I'm sitting on a gold mine here. Exactly. Exactly. I know. I mean, it's really changing. And the more self-reliant you can be, the better off you are. Yeah, completely. So where do you see things going then in a broad sense? I think that we're going to see more people leaning toward the self-reliant stuff. Remember when we first started having the COVID lockdowns and all of these people who never had done this stuff previously were suddenly they were trading sourdough starters and they were you know knitting and they were gardening and baking and doing all this awesome stuff I think we're gonna see that trend continue and I think that's wonderful. I think bringing America back to being a productive country instead of a consumptive country is really, really important. And maybe this is the way to do it. Yeah. Isn't that interesting? The silver lining of having the global supply chain shut down. But a lot of the signals that we're watching are showing that these global supply chain disruptions are going to get far worse because of well, you know collapsing currencies trade wars, you know the Bricks nations versus Western nations and so on I I Don't I don't think things are ever going to be as readily available and as cheap as as they were You know two or three years ago or three years. I agree. I agree. I think this is a a permanent change. You know, I spend a lot of time in Greece. It's it's one of my favorite places and I spend a fair bit of time in Athens Greece and it's a big city but every single balcony is loaded with vegetables and fruits. Every single one. I mean that place it is the it is such a green city and it's just what you do. You go home and you take care of your tomato plants and balconies there on apartment buildings are set up so that people can garden. They've got hoses and, you know, water hookups and water catchment and all sorts of stuff. A lot of people have built in boxes. The place that I usually stay when I'm there, I have a little garden in the back. It's like a little basement and there's a little garden with ground where I can plant. And it's got an olive tree and orange trees and stuff like that. And when you go shopping, there are supermarkets, but the food there is not very good and it's really not ideal. The best places to shop, they have a weekly market, and the market moves from neighborhood to neighborhood. Really? Yep, the farmers bring their produce. And they come from a few hours away, two or three hours away. And they just set up their little stand in a road, and you can go there and you can buy stuff. And then when you go shopping at the shops, there's a vegetable stand, there's a fruit stand, there is a bakery, there's a pastry shop, there's a dairy shop. So every shop is specialized. And if you get the owner talking, they'll tell you why their vegetables are the best because their vegetables come from their cousin who lives on Santorini or some island or they live just two hours north and they have the best soil and that's why their tomatoes are better than Joe's tomatoes across the street. And they take such pride in what they're offering. I love that because it's also there's a sense of community. You're getting to meet the people. There is. There is. Like I know the people that I buy food from there. Right. And they know where the food came from. You know, I might be in a big city, but it has almost like a small town feel. Because everyone I buy from is within walking distance. And of course, the food doesn't come from within walking distance, but you don't get a lot of imported stuff there. All the food that you buy there at the little shops and the stands is food that's raised right there in Greece. Well, and there's also, you know, nutritionally and from a health standpoint, there's a very powerful factor of eating with the seasons, right? Absolutely. Eating local foods and foods that and the average consumer in America today really doesn't have a sense of, oh, you mean squash is supposed to be in the fall? You know, they don't really know this stuff because it's always available. Exactly. And, you know, I am so much healthier when I'm there because the food is so much higher quality. Um, I used to have hypothyroid, hypothyroidism, and it completely reversed, which I was told was impossible after I spent a year in Europe. That is truly fascinating. And I'm wondering too, with all the food growing on the balconies, does that mean, is there a premium for south facing balconies on high rise buildings? Probably so. I don't know because I've never really shopped, but I would imagine so. But I mean, the latitude of Greece is pretty far north, I think. It's a Mediterranean country. It doesn't get super, super cold in the winter. You have about a month where it's around 40 or 50, but that's about as cold as it gets. 80 lower than that's a fluke and it's very sunny. They have I believe it's like almost 300 sunny days per year Well, okay, that that makes a lot of sense and I know the I know the area is known You know like southern france even for example is known but I you know for food production but I thought a lot of that was due to the jet stream and the warm ocean water currents kind of bringing warmth to that area. It could be. I'm not really sure, but the produce there is just the best I've ever had. Well, there you go, the Mediterranean diet. It's one of the healing modalities. It certainly is.
